what is the difference between ^ and ~ in versions
what is minor update and major update
Bundlers
npm

package.json is a configuration for app
package-lock.json

whatever things we can regenerate never to put it on git

npm is used to install package
npx is used to execute the app

parcel builds the app and hosts in to a server

Never to use to CDN links in production because it is expensive operation and it reduces the speed might give errors in update and if they update the URL later they we have keep changing the urls


Its good to install react as a dependency


How your application is fast?
it is not only beacuse of react there are lots of things and one of them is parcel it is a bundler and it does lots of cool things for us.
