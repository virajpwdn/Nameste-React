# 🧠 Microservices, Data Fetching & React useEffect: Explained Like You're 5

---

## 🧩 What is a Microservice?

> "A microservice is designed to handle **one specific job** and can run **independently** without getting disturbed by others."

Imagine your school has:

* 🧹 A janitor (cleaning service)
* 🍽️ A cook (kitchen service)
* 🏫 A teacher (education service)

Each one does their **own task** and can keep working even if another is busy. That’s how microservices work!

### ⚙️ In Tech Terms:

* Microservices are **independent mini-apps** that work together.
* They **talk via APIs** (like sending letters or emails to each other).

Example: If your app needs to show a list of restaurants, it may call the `restaurant-service` microservice.

## 🔄 Data Fetching in Web Apps (2 Approaches)

When a user opens your website, you have **two ways to get data**:

### 1️⃣ Blocking Data Fetch (Before UI Renders)

* We wait to show the UI **until all data is ready**.
* Think of it like: "I won’t open the gift until Mom comes with the cake."

#### 📦 Example:

* Using `getServerSideProps` in Next.js
* Using `useEffect` with a loader before rendering content

#### 🟨 Drawback:

* Slower to display anything at first

---

### 2️⃣ Non-Blocking Data Fetch (After UI Renders)

* Show UI **right away** with placeholders or skeletons.
* Then fill in the data when it arrives.
* Like serving an empty plate and filling it once food is ready 🍽️

#### 📦 Example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

#### 🟩 Benefit:

* Feels faster and smoother for the user

## ⚛️ React's useEffect Hook

### 🧠 What is it?

`useEffect` is a special function in React that lets you do something **after the component shows up on screen**.

#### 💡 What kind of "something"?

We call these **side effects**:

* Fetching data from APIs
* Updating the DOM
* Listening to events

### 🔁 When does useEffect run?

* After the **first render** (like "when the component is born")
* After any **change in state/props** (unless controlled by dependency array)

### 🔍 Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('This runs after the component is rendered!');
}, []); // Runs once on mount
```

---

## 🎮 Dynamic UI with useState

```js
let [btnName, setBtnName] = useState("Login");
```

This line:

* Creates a state variable `btnName`
* Allows you to change it using `setBtnName`

### 🔄 Example:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  btnName === "Login" ? setBtnName("Logout") : setBtnName("Login");
}}>
  {btnName}
</button>
```

### 💡 Why not use a regular variable?

Because **React doesn’t re-render the component** when a plain variable changes. But it **does** re-render when `useState` is used!

---

## ⚛️ Re-rendering & React's Diffing Algorithm

Every time you update state (`setBtnName()`), React **re-renders the component**.

> This means React re-builds the HTML (virtually), compares it to the old version, and updates only the parts that changed.

### 🔍 This is called the **Reconciliation Cycle**.

#### ⚡ React uses a "Diffing Algorithm"

* It quickly figures out **what changed** in the virtual DOM
* And updates **only the necessary parts** of the real DOM

---

## 🧠 Analogy: School Notice Board

Think of your UI like a school notice board 📝:

* Old notices are on the board
* You write new notices (state changes)
* React compares old vs new, and updates only the notices that changed

That’s how React keeps things fast and efficient!

---

## ✅ Summary for a Child:

* Microservices = Tiny workers doing specific tasks
* Blocking fetch = Wait until cake is ready to start party 🎂
* Non-blocking fetch = Start party and bring the cake later 🍰
* useEffect = Do something after showing the screen
* useState = Lets you update and track changes
* React re-renders on state change, but smartly updates only changed parts

----------------------------------------------------



"A microservice is designed to handle one specific responsibility, and it should operate independently without being interrupted by other services."

In micro services architecure multiple server talks to each other via api endpoints 

There are 2 ways to fetch data from backend

1. As soon the client lands on the website we won't load ui until data is fetched from backed
2. In second approach ui loads renders and when api fetchs the data it is displayed

. Blocking Data Fetch (Before UI Render)
Data is fetched before rendering the UI.

The UI waits until the data arrives before displaying anything (or shows a loader).

Ensures that the page loads with all necessary data already available.

📦 Example:
Using getServerSideProps in Next.js or making a fetch call before rendering in a useEffect (with loading logic).

🟨 Drawback: Slightly slower perceived performance due to waiting for data.

2. Non-Blocking Data Fetch (After UI Render)
The UI renders immediately, often with placeholders or skeletons.

Data is fetched after render, and the content updates once the data arrives.

📦 Example:
Using useEffect in functional components to fetch data after initial render.

🟩 Benefit: Faster perceived load time and smoother user experience.



useEffect Hook -> useEffect is a hook in react when used in a component it immediately renders after the component is rendered 

useEffect is a React Hook that runs a side effect after the component has rendered.

🔍 Explanation:
"Side effect" means anything that affects something outside the component, like:

Fetching data

Updating the DOM

Subscribing to events

Setting timers

It runs after the initial render and after every update, unless you control it with a dependency array.

"useEffect is a hook in React that allows you to run side effects in a component. It executes after the component mounts and after updates, depending on the dependency array."






let [btnName , setBtnName] = useState('Login');

  return (
    <div className="header p-3 m-5">
      <div className="logo">
        <img
          className="logo"
          src="https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/food-ordering-app-logo-with-points-fork-shapes-center_666184-195.jpg"
          alt=""
        />
      </div>
      <div className="nav-items">
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>About Us</li>
          <li>Contact Us</li>
          <li>Cart</li>
          <button className='login' onClick={()=> {
            btnName === "Login" ? setBtnName('Logout') : setBtnName('Login');
          } }>{btnName}</button>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

First of all in react we can use javascript variables to store data but we cannot update it dynamically like how we do it with useState(). As you can see in the above code we have use a usesate to store login string and when the button is clicked it will be updated to logout. 

very very important thing to note over here is any many developers don't know about it that is when setBtnName is invoked it re-renders the entire components, yes it does that and when this happen diff alogrithm comes into picture and it differenats which part of code has changed and only updates that but it re renders the entire component.

why, how, when

whenever a state variable is updateed, react trigger reconcialiation cycle where component is rerenders
